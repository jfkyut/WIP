          I am Jake Francis Arnosa, 23 years old. Born in Caloocan, Manila on October 14, 1999. Currently living in San Vicente, Palawan for 17 years. A Computer Science Student of Palawan State University.

          When I was a kid, I am not so sure of what I want to be in the future 'til I turn 22, I want to be a Web Developer now and that's kind of weird 'cause I am not the type of student who is expose on computers. When I first go to college in Puerto Princesa City, I choose to take the path of an IT, still I am not so sure of what I want to be in the future. It's like I just pick it randomly. After 1 year of studying there, I transfer back home in San Vicente and choose the path of a Computer Science. My first year spent in college was kind of waste because I also choose almost the same path as before.

          As I am being a first year student again, I still am not into programming, I just do programming for assignments and task accomplishment purposes. But I'm not really into making real projects. I don't study in advance to learn more. As I age, I just recently thought that I have to have a life in the future and I have to grind for something I can use long term.

          Now I finaally decided that I want to be a programmer someday but I'm not really sure of what kind of programmer I should be. Then the kotlin was introduce during our class in our first semester of third year college. I try to study about mobile development and research about this field, and what I learn is that there is lesser opportunity or job openings in mobile development. I found that in different sections of development world, the web has the most number of opportunities. So at first I study HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm still learning though, cause until now I am not that good yet.
