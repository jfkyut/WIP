        <div class="autobiography">
          Hello, My name is Jake Francis Arnosa, and I am 23 years old. I am currently a college student studying Computer Science. I may not have accomplished much in my life so far, but I have learned so much and have had so many experiences that have shaped who I am today. Writing this autobiography is a way for me to reflect on my journey so far and to document my thoughts and experiences for future reference. I hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire others to explore their own experiences and to never stop learning and growing.

          I was born on October 14, 1999 at Caloocan, Manila. At this early years in my life, I am really into drawing. I have one brother and we both like to draw. As I remember, when my mother take us both out, we try to remember how vehicles look like and we draw it when we got home. At the time I was four years old. I'm not good at drawing though, I just like doing it as a kid. By the time I was 5, we move here in San Vicente, Palawan from Manila.

          In my high school days, I am not the smart one type of student who always at the top of the class. I was just a typical high school kid. Well there is a year where I was at the top of the class, that was my first time and also the last time. After that year, I was move in different section where I don't have any close friends at all. That was the first time in my life that I feel alone for the most part of the year. I feel like I have no friends with me. I was also not the type of student that will approach first so I didn't make that much of friends. There is only 1 or 2 friends I've got at the end of that year. After that, I was getting use to it. I finally enjoy my personal space without trying to fit in with other's circle of friends, I still got few though. I don't feel alone anymore like before, almost all of my classmates during this time are friendly, but there are times that I prefer to be alone.

          My senior year. At this stage of my life, this was the first time I feel worry about what should I be doing in the future as I suppose to choose a path related to what I want to pursue in college. But still I am not decided yet so I choose General Academic Strand as I heard that this path is for undecided students. I choose it and was decided that after a year or 2, I have to know of what I really want to become in the future. But unfortunately, after 2 years , I still am not decided. I guess my problem here is I really don't fully know myself yet. 
          <br>
          <br>
          College life, I choose to pursue Information Technology at Palawan State University Main Campus. I feel like I chose it out of nowhere. I am not the type of student who is expose on computers. I also am not one of those students that almost live in a computer shops during high school days. I only know a little about computers because I am not really into it. At the time I was trying to imagine that being an IT person can be a good thing though, as almost all of the office needed an IT people. During my first year in college, I was not intimidated at all even though I am not that good in computers. We taught some basic programming. It was cool thinking that how some things work behind the scene. I was fascinated but I still am not into it to the point that I should study on my own to learn how to code. I just do coding for assignments and activity purposes only.
          <br>
          <br>
          After my first year in college, I transfer back home in San Vicente, Palawan for some reason that I do not want to include to tell. So I choose Computer Science because they do not offer IT program. I was first year again, still not improved after that school year cause I don't study on my own. I was just taking of what the University is giving.

          At that time pandemic happen. It was a hard time the next 2 years. I was enrolled for the next 2 years, but I really not into school anymore. There are courses I left behind in 2 years
